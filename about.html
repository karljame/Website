                Shrek, animated cartoon character,
                 a towering, green ogre whose fearsome appearance belies a kind heart.
                  Shrek is the star of a highly successful series of animated films. 
                    The source for the character Shrek was the childrenâ€™s book Shrek!(1990) by William Steig. 
                DreamWorks Pictures acquired the film rights to the character and introduced him to a much larger audience in the hit computer-animated film.
