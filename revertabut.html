                    Shrek, animated cartoon character,
                     a towering, green ogre whose fearsome appearance belies a kind heart.
                    Shrek is the star of a highly successful series of animated films.
                    The source for the character Shrek was the childrenâ€™s book Shrek!(1990) by William Steig.
                     DreamWorks Pictures acquired the film rights to the character and introduced him to a much larger audience in the hit computer-animated film.
